   - *Django Initialization:* Created a new Django project and set up the project structure by creating the necessary apps.
   - *Environment Configuration:* Configured the development environment, including database setup and necessary dependencies.

2. *Data Models:*
   - *Model Definition:* Defined Django models to represent the data entities.
   - *Database Migration:* Performed migrations to create the corresponding database tables.

3. *API Development:*
   - *Django REST Framework:* Developed RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework to enable data retrieval and manipulation.
   - *Endpoints:* Created API endpoints for CRUD operations and integrated authentication mechanisms to secure the APIs.

4. *Data Population:*
   - *Data Import Scripts:* Wrote scripts to import data into the database.
   - *Manual Data Entry:* Added necessary data manually through Django admin interface.

5. *Frontend Development:*
   - *HTML Templates:* Designed dynamic HTML templates to structure the web pages.
   - *CSS Styling:* Utilized CSS for styling to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.
   - *Bootstrap:* Incorporated Bootstrap to enhance the layout and make it mobile-friendly.

6. *Data Visualization:*

   - *Permissions:* Set up user roles and permissions to control access to different parts of the dashboard.

9. *Deployment:*
   - *Web Server:* Deployed the application using Github as the application server.

### Outcome

This project significantly enhanced my skills in Django, RESTful API development, frontend design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and data visualization with Google Chart. It also provided valuable experience in deploying and securing a web application.
